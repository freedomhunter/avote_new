## API Node Recommendations

`aVote` is a light wallet, which means it relies on an external API node connected to the Arisen blockchain network in order to function.

The list below contains Arisen API nodes run by members of the Arisen community that you can choose from.

### Privacy

Even though your keys never leave the `aVote` applications, the API node you connect to can still reveal personally identifiable information about you. This information may include:

- Account Names
- IP Addresses

If you are concerned about revealing this information to any of these 3rd party API nodes, it is recommended you run your own API Node and connect to that.

We will update this list as the community finds more reliable 3rd party nodes for usage with this tool.
