## Decentralized banking network node Recommendations

`aVote` is a light wallet, which means it relies on an external Decentralized banking network node connected to the Arisen blockchain network in order to function.

The list below contains Arisen Decentralized banking network nodes run by members of the Arisen community that you can choose from.

### Privacy

Even though your keys never leave the `aVote` applications, the Decentralized banking network node you connect to can still reveal personally identifiable information about you. This information may include:

- Account Names
- IP Addresses

If you are concerned about revealing this information to any of these 3rd party Decentralized banking network nodes, it is recommended you run your own Decentralized banking network node and connect to that.
